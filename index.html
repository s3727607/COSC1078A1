    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <br><br>
    <p>From my name, you might guess that I am an international student from China. I have been in Australia for two years, and I have graduatedfrom year 12 and diploma of IT. I have never thought about taking IT course before high school, because I like to play with models in my spare time, I have been playing models for nearly five years, so I also like to bury my head in front of my desk, and then I went to year 12, found that IT professional and my hobbies coincide. It also requires patience and strength. Working at a desk requires  bit of correction. So I started to feel familiar and like the inexplicable IT. Later, I played computer games, and I was fascinated by the computer. I wanted to study and didn't know where to start, so I decided to take the IT major and chose to study the relevant knowledge carefully.</p>
    <br><br>
    <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
    <br><br>
    <p>My interest in IT began with my high school thinking about what I wanted to do in the future. It was still a few years ago, I thought the programmer was very mysterious. It was still cutting-edge technology at the time, and most people didn't understand it. After all, writing on a notebook is much better than writing on a paper, and electronic products are quickly entering people's lives.When the B.P call went to the button mobile phone and then went to the full-screen smart phone, the update of the electronic product was a leap. I was eager to join this fast-growing industry, so I chose IT after a few years.</p>

    <p>VR helmet has always been a wearable device that I want to have. It can completely bring users into a virtual world, and use bioelectricity to stimulate the brain to bring people close to the real feeling. This idea is from an anime "Sword Art Online" , this anime is about what happened in this VR helmet game. The closest thing to this project is VR glasses, but VR glasses are not able to give people a more exciting feeling.</p>
    <p>In the current era, most real-world technologies are no longer able to satisfy the users of the game, and the complete virtual world gives a lot of embarrassment. If people can do something in a completely virtual world, this is a question that every big player will think about, which is why I think of this project. Augmented reality, holographic images, these technologies are all about VR, until Google glasses announced the end of production in 2015, the topic is gradually less. But people who are really interested in VR are still studying, such as Google, Microsoft, Samsung, they are still committed to the development of VR glasses, but this is only a visually new experience. And what I want is a wearable device that can be feedback from the sense of touch, hearing, and vision. This requires bioengineering technology on the product.</p>
