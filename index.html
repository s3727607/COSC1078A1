      <h3>· Information Technology</h3>
      <p>I have never thought about taking IT course before high school. I like to play with GUMPLA(an specific model type) in my spare time, I have been playing GUMPLA for nearly five years, so I also like to bury my head in front of my desk, and then I went to year 12, found that IT professional and my hobbies coincide.</p>
      <p>It also requires patience and strength. Working at a desk requires bit of correction. So I started to feel familiar and like the inexplicable IT. Later, I played computer games, and I was fascinated by the computer. I wanted to study and didn't know where to start, so I decided to take the IT major and chose to study the relevant knowledge carefully.</p>
      <h3>· Education to Date</h3>
      <p>Year 7-Year 10: Wuhan No.2 Middle School (2011-2014)</p>
      <p>Year 11&12 : Buckley Park College (2015-2017)</p>
      <p>Diploma : RMIT - Diploma of IT (2018-2019)</p>

      <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
      <br><br />
      <div>My interest in IT began with my high school thinking about what I wanted to do in the future. It was still a few years ago, I thought the programmer was very mysterious. It was still cutting-edge technology at the time, and most people didn't understand it. After all, writing on a notebook is much better than writing on a paper, and electronic products are quickly entering people's lives.When the B.P call went to the button mobile phone and then went to the full-screen smart phone, the update of the electronic product was a leap. I was eager to join this fast-growing industry, so I chose IT after a few years.</div>

      <h2>Idea Job</h2>
      <br><br />
      <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/39685109?searchrequesttoken=a447227d-0b71-4465-9a17-60f86a5f72fa&type=standard">Junior Software Engineers</a>
      <p>My idea job didn't think very far, maybe I will be qualified for this job when I graduated. I wanted to be a software engineer a long time ago. Then develop interesting programs that let customers use my software happily. So I really like this profession, and I have a proper understanding of it's technical requirements now.</p>
      <p>Technical requirements for this position:</p>
      <p>·A reliable development language such as Java, C#, Python, etc.</p>
      <p>·SQL Server</p>
      <p>·Visual Studio</p>
      <p>·JavaScript, HTML, CSS</p>
      <p>·Excellent communication skills - Share ideas, communicate openly with peers and promote standards of development</p>
      <p>I've already had some of above basic skills, such as html, css, JavaScript, Java, and the rest (C#, Python, SQL) are the technologies I need to learn during college, and I will delve into the techniques I have mastered.</p>
      <br><br />

      <p>Although these data can not represent my real person, it is indeed a reference indicator for me. In my opinion, this data allows me to understand myself more specifically. As the learning test shows, I am a visual learner. I fully agree with this point. There is no way for my subconscious to grasp the abstract things. But if it is a very specific thing, then I will remember or learn very quickly. For example, I chose IT instead of business haha! Those abstract theories are more difficult to understand and learn than actual code.</p>
      <p>The structure of a team is simply the leader and the team members. After the leader receives the task and discusses with the group member and then assigns the task, the leader needs experience and determination. He needs to make the right choices right away from his experience, and he can't hesitate to let the team members question the task and slow down the work. The team members need to do the assigned work well and meet the mission requirements. They cannot slow down the whole project because they are slow. This requires patience and seriousness. So I may be more suitable for team members at the moment, and carefully assign the assigned tasks.</p>
      <p>So when teaming up, I might need to find an experienced and determined leader and do the assignment. Let me play my abilities better.</p>

      <h2>Project Idea</h2>
      <h3>· Overview</h3>
      <img src="image/VR Helmet.jpg" width="300" height="150" />
      <p>VR helmet has always been a wearable device that I want to have. It can completely bring users into a virtual world, and use bioelectricity to stimulate the brain to bring people close to the real feeling. This idea is from an anime "Sword Art Online" , this anime is about what happened in this VR helmet game. The closest thing to this project is VR glasses, but VR glasses are not able to give people a more exciting feeling now.</p>

      <h3>· Motivation</h3>
      <p>In the current era, most real-world technologies are no longer able to satisfy the users of the game, and the complete virtual world gives a lot of embarrassment. If people can do something in a completely virtual world, this is a question that every big player will think about, which is why I think of this project. Augmented reality, holographic images, these technologies are all about VR, until Google glasses announced the end of production in 2015, the topic is gradually less. But people who are really interested in VR are still studying, such as Google, Microsoft, Samsung, they are still committed to the development of VR glasses, but this is only a visually new experience. And what I want is a wearable device that can be feedback from the sense of touch and vision. This requires bioelectronics technology on the product.</p>

      <h3>· Description</h3>
      <p>This VR Helmet's concept features a head-mounted display (HMD) and a game engine (Unity3D)-based gesture recognition technology, as well as bioelectronics technology for safety.</p>
      <p>The workflow of this product is to receive user input from the gesture recognition device in the virtual reality operating system to simulate the mouse and keyboard, and provide output through the head-mounted display and bioelectric signal transmitter & bio-probe to achieve user's comprehensive immersive experience.</p>
      <p>This will bring a new boom in the hardware market, which can show users an experience that they have never had before. For example, the wearable device can be fully fed back to the user's palm touch, which can limit the player's action by changing its hardness to virtualize the existence of the object in the program. And by radiating micro-current to the player's hand, it brings almost real touch, which can deepen the user's impression of the game and a more realistic operating experience. There is also a wide-angle 156° curved display, which is ergonomically perfect for Monocular horizontal perspective and gives the picture a more three-dimensional look.</p>

      <h3>· Tools & Technologies</h3>
      <p><strong>Hardware:</strong> Hardware requires a head-mounted display, a pair of somatosensory gloves (including multiple sets of electrode patches and multiple bionic joint sets), a set of built-in stereos, and a small vibration motor (simulating the vibration of the head)</p>
      <p><strong>Software:</strong></p>
      <p> 1. Write code directly using android opengl api, and also provide some useful VR components. But the downside is that you need to be familiar with open gl.</p>
      <p> 2. Provides the interface for ios open gl programming, same as above.</p>
      <p> 3. Provide the unity plugin, you can import it in unity, then use c# or js for development, and get started quickly. In addition, Cardboard VR (and Gearvr) is supported by default on the latest unity.</p>
      <p> 4. Provide native support for unreal.</p>

      <h3>· Skills Required</h3>
      <p>As a VR program developer, it needs the ability to develop 3D games, and it needs to know more about the current mainstream 3D engine, Unity/Unreal. There are also 3D art tools, such as 3Ds Max, Maya, Zbrush, etc., and familiar with scripting languages such as MaxScript, UnrealScript, etc. will greatly help VR program development。 VR language is the language development of the 3D programming engine. VR can't be developed without the support of 3D engines (such as: unity and ue4). The main language used for 3D engines and programming is C#/C++, which is beyond doubt.</p>
      <p>1. First, be proficient in C#: C# basic grammar and algorithm, object-oriented programming, C# is data structure and advanced grammar; it is the basic language of U3D. Unity uses C# as a scripting language. Unity3D engine structure and physical structure, UGUI and animation system, navigation system, data storage, database, coroutine, WWW class, network, resource management, special effects system, performance optimization;</p>
      <p>2, c + + language: Unreal engine is also developed using C + +. MiddleVR provides a C++-based SDK.</p>
      <p>3, Javascript: It is also a scripting language for Unity (even if there are not many people selected). But the base of WebVR and Javascript programmers (base friends?) will definitely make Javascript continue to dominate the number of users (I am really not black). Even without considering WebVR, the already mature HTML5 3D engine such as three.js and Babylonjs is enough to prove the powerful vitality of Javascript in 3D.</p>
      <p>4. And other computer graphics and GPU programming: computer graphics and Shader programming.</p>
      <h3>· Outcome</h3>
      <p>If this project is successfully completed, there may be more people joining the virtual reality field, and it will attract a large number of game enthusiasts, and even use this equipment in other fields. Such as, use VR equipment for remote surgery, or watch an exhibition (house exhibition, fashion show, museum) in a VR device. I am still happy to see these situations, but there is another extreme possibility that I am worried about. It might be a bad start to have a very perfect VR game in the future, so that most young people are immersed in it and occur some bad things. So that we should be ready to face this situation when this product arrived!</p>
